Please note this app is slow to start and very performance intensive. This application was meant as a graphical demonstration and thusly was not optimized to the fullest extent. This is largely due to the resources which are being loaded, and not necessarilly with the algorithms themselves

A marble game programmed in C++ using OpenGL graphics. The program includes a reader for blender files (which was programmed from scratch), which are read and then rendered using OpenGL graphics. The user is able to control a marble which rolls and must avoid obstacles. The game includes music which changes as the marble progresses through the stages of the game, gravity physics, and animations.
